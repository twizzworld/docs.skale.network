= Using SKALE-ML

== What is SKALE-ML

SKALE-ML is a unique tool that allows SKALE developers to combine trained machine learning models with smart contracts. It provides a method to forward propagate data and control smart contract logic based on model outcomes.

* Use TensorFlow/Keras ML models to control dApp logic.
* Decentralize and store trained models using SKALE Filestorage.
* Leverage SKALE's zero-cost gas to perform forward propagation in EVM.

== Example ideas of what you can build with SKALE-ML

* Autonomously filter file uploads using a decentralized ResNet neural network.
* Identify malicious transactions and pause a bridge using a KNN classifier.
* Generate NFT images using a decentralized GAN model.
* Re-balance a DAO treasury using a portfolio optimizer.
* Build an IMA chatbot using an NLP model.

== How it works

. Developers build and train a model using TensorFlow/Keras.
. Developers upload a trained h5 model and file converter to a SKALE Chain's filestorage.
. SKALE-ML contracts and precompiles run the predict() method on users' inputs.
. SKALE-ML forward propagates input data through the h5 model and outputs a file with results.
. Endpoints call getResults() to receive the prediction output.
