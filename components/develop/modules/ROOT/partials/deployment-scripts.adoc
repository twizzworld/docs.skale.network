Hardhat::
+
--


Hardhat is a popular development environment for deploying and verifying smart contracts on EVM blockchains. 

Hardhat is fully compatible with SKALE Network. +


[discrete] 
== Overview 

Below are the steps needed to update your hardhat configuration for deploying and verifying your SKALE chain. +

1. Make a `.env`` with SKALE configuration 
2. Update `hardhat.config` with dotenv variables
3. Write or add a deploy script using ethers.js or web3.js
4. Deploy with the `--network skale` flag
5. Verify all dependencies for verification are installed
6. Verify with returned contract address and any constructors- if any +

[TIP]
Alternatively, you can use this preconfigured https://github.com/skalenetwork/hardhat-skale[SKALE hardhat repository] set for Chaos open testnet 

[discrete] 
=== CONFIGURATION
The code below shows how to configure hardhat with your private key and a SKALE RPC endpoint for SKALE Chaos open testnet.

1. To deploy your smart contracts onto SKALE Chaos (or other SKALE chain ), you will need to write a script using ethers or web3. 
+
[NOTE] 
For much more information on hardhat configuration and deployment scripts visit: https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/docs/advanced/hardhat-runtime-environment#hardhat-runtime-environment-hre[Hardhat’s Documentation]. 
+
2. Copy or Configure your `.env` for SKALE Network:

=== DEPLOYING


1. To deploy your smart contracts from hardhat you will need to https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/docs/advanced/scripts#writing-scripts-with-hardhat[write or reuse a deployment script] 
+
[IMPORTANT]
Certain plugins (e.g., hardhat-deploy ) can check previous transactions. If you are not connected to an Archive Node please use flags to disable the `boolean` for previous transactions check (for hardhat-deploy - skipIfAlreadyDeployed)
+
{empty}
2. You can now use the flag `--network skale` with your deployment scripts.
+
****
[discrete]
==== Example deployment command:

[source, shell] 
---- 
npx hardhat run ./scripts/<<your script>> --network skale
----
****
[NOTE]
After a successful deployment, the returned address will be used in the verification command. Save it before clearing your terminal! 


[discrete]
=== VERIFYING

1. Before verifying with hardhat CLI make sure you have installed the necessary dependencies:
+
****
[discrete]
==== Dependencies:

[source, shell]
----
npm install --save-dev "@ethersproject/providers@^5.4.7" "@nomicfoundation/hardhat-network-helpers@^1.0.0" "@nomicfoundation/hardhat-chai-matchers@^1.0.0" "@nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers@^2.0.0" "@types/chai@^4.2.0" "@types/mocha@^9.1.0" "@typechain/ethers-v5@^10.1.0" "@typechain/hardhat@^6.1.2" "chai@^4.2.0" "ethers@^5.4.7" "hardhat-gas-reporter@^1.0.8" "solidity-coverage@^0.7.21" "ts-node@>=8.0.0" "typechain@^8.1.0" "typescript@>=4.5.0" "dotenv@^16.0.1" "@openzeppelin/contracts@^4.7.0" "@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox@^1.0.2" "@nomiclabs/hardhat-etherscan@^3.1.5"
----
****

2. Copy the address in the terminal returned from successfully deploying, and run the verification command
+
****
[discrete]
==== Example deployment command:

[source, shell]
----
npx hardhat verify <<contract address>> --network skale "add any simple constructor"
----
****
[IMPORTANT]
🛠️ If you have no constructors, the "add constructor" can be omitted +
🚧 See https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/plugins/nomicfoundation-hardhat-verify#complex-arguments[Hardhat Docs] for handling complex constructors (multiple type constructors)
{empty}
3. After a few moments, hardhat will return a link to a verified contract if successful.
{empty}
[NOTE]
٭ Verification may take anywhere from a few seconds to a few minutes depending on contract size +
٭ Upon successful verification, Hardhat will return Etherscan, but please use Blockscout. ( This is an artifact of the plugin )

Truffle::
+
--

Truffle is a popular way to deploy your smart contracts onto Ethereum, and can also be used to deploy your smart contracts onto SKALE. You can update your truffle configuration file (truffle-config.js) with a configuration to deploy your smart contracts onto SKALE.  

For more information on truffle configuration files, please see (https://truffleframework.com/docs/truffle/reference/configuration[Truffle's Configuration Documentation].  

NOTE: To deploy your smart contracts onto SKALE, the transaction needs to be signed. This code below shows how to use the @truffle/hdwallet-provider package to sign the transaction with the private key of your wallet.  

[source,javascript]
----
/*
 * This truffle script will deploy your smart contracts to your SKALE Chain.
 *
 *  @param {String} privateKey - Provide your wallet private key.
 *  @param {String} provider - Provide your SKALE endpoint address.
 */

let HDWalletProvider = require("@truffle/hdwallet-provider");

//Provide your wallet private key
let privateKey = "[YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY]";

//Provide your SKALE endpoint address
let skale = "[YOUR_SKALE_CHAIN_ENDPOINT]";

module.exports = {
    networks: {
        ganache: {
            host: "127.0.0.1",
            port: 8545,
            network_id: "*"
        },
        skale: {
            provider: () => new HDWalletProvider(privateKey, skale),
            gasPrice: 0,
            network_id: "*"
        }
    }
}
----

You can point your deployment scripts for your existing smart contracts to your SKALE Chain’s address and deploy using existing tooling (e.g.: Truffle). An example truffle deployment command to deploy your smart contracts using the 'skale' network in the script above is:  

```shell
truffle deploy --reset --network skale --compile-all
```

--

Node.js::
+
--

Node.jsSmart contracts can be deployed with just the use of web3.js as well. Below you will find a simple script for using NodeJS and web3.  

NOTE: Web3 and solc versions matter for compatibility. Web3 1.0.0-beta.35 and solc version 0.5.4 work well together, but other version combinations can cause unexpected errors.  

For more information on using web3.js, please see https://web3js.readthedocs.io/[Web3.js Ethereum JavaScript API].  

[source,javascript]
----
/*
 * This nodeJS script will deploy your smart contracts to your new S-Chain.
 *
 *  @param {String} private key - Provide your private key.
 *  @param {String} account - Provide your account address.
 *  @param {String} SKALE Chain endpoint - provide your SKALE Chain endpoint
 *  @param {String} contractName - Name of your smart contract (i.e. MySmartContract)
 *  @param {String} contractFileName - Complete filename of contract (i.e. MySmartContract.sol)
 */

const Web3 = require('web3');
const solc = require('solc');
const path = require('path');
const fs = require('fs');

let privateKey = "[YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY]";
let account = "[YOUR_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS]";
let schainEndpoint = "[YOUR_SKALE_CHAIN_ENDPOINT]";

let contractName = "HelloSKALE"; //replace with your contract name
let contractFileName = "HelloSKALE.sol"; //replace with the filename of the contract

//Retrieve and compile contract source code
const contractPath = path.resolve(__dirname, 'contracts', contractFileName);
const contractContent = fs.readFileSync(contractPath, 'UTF-8');

//Format contract for solc reader
var contracts = {
  language: 'Solidity',
  sources: {},
  settings: {
    outputSelection: {
      '*': {
        '*': [ '*' ]
      }
    }
  }
}

//add HelloSKALE contract to contract sources
contracts.sources[contractFileName] = { content: contractContent };

//compile data via solc reader
let solcOutput = JSON.parse(solc.compile(JSON.stringify(contracts)));

//get compile HelloSKALE contract
let contractCompiled = solcOutput.contracts[contractFileName][contractName];

//Connect Web3 to your SKALE Chain
const web3 = new Web3(new Web3.providers.HttpProvider(schainEndpoint));


//create transaction 
var tx = {
  data : '0x' + contractCompiled.evm.bytecode.object,
  from: account, 
  gasPrice: 0,
  gas: 80000000
};

//sign transaction to deploy contract
web3.eth.accounts.signTransaction(tx, privateKey).then(signed => {
  web3.eth.sendSignedTransaction(signed.rawTransaction).
    on('receipt', receipt => {
     console.log(receipt)
   }).
    catch(console.error);
});

Deploy allows you to deploy a smart contract to any EVM compatible
network without configuring RPC URLs, exposing your private keys,
writing scripts, and other additional setup such as verifying your
contract.

. To deploy your smart contract using deploy, navigate to the root
directory of your project and execute the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
npx thirdweb deploy
----
+
Executing this command will trigger the following actions:

* Compiling all the contracts in the current directory.
* Providing the option to select which contract(s) you wish to deploy.
* Uploading your contract source code (ABI) to IPFS.
. When it is completed, it will open a dashboard interface to finish
filling out the parameters.
* `+_name+`: contract name
* `+_symbol+`: symbol or "`ticker`"
* `+_royaltyRecipient+`: wallet address to receive royalties from
secondary sales
* `+_royaltyBps+`: basis points (bps) that will be given to the royalty
recipient for each secondary sale, e.g. 500 = 5%
. Select Skale as the network
. Manage additional settings on your contract’s dashboard as needed such
as uploading NFTs, configuring permissions, and more.
