== How To Use Cookbook

The following sections will help guide you through using the no-code deployment tools seen in the example video above. You will learn how to search, deploy, and view your deployed smart contracts.

=== Search on the smart contract registry

Start by navigating to link:https://cookbook.dev[Cookbook] and search for the smart contract you would like to use or deploy.

[TIP]
You can try searching for topics such as token or dao

=== Using No Code Deployment 

Once you have chosen your smart contract, proceed by clicking on *No-Code Deploy*.

[IMPORTANT]
It is recommended to use the No-Code Deployment option as it will handle SKALE Chain access and sFUEL ("gas token") distribution for you. +
Other options such as Remix, ChainIDE, and manual deployment may require additional steps that are not listed here. +

You can now configure your smart contract with the parameters you want. In the example below, you would put in the name of your token (eg. TOKEN) , the token symbol (eg. SYM), the total supply (eg. 100000), and lastly the selection of 0 or 18 for NFT or ERC-20. Once all the fields are filled in, select *Pick Chain*

Navigate to the SKALE tab and select your preferred chain. Be sure to click *_Get sFUEL_* if you don't have any.

=== Check your deployed smart contract on Dashboard

Once the smart contract is deployed, you may check the address on the "My Dashboard" page.
On this page you can:

* Download the ABI, Bytecode, Source Code, or Verification Data

* Read directly from the contract

* Write directly to the contract (if you have permission to do so)
